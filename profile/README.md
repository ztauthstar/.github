# ZTAuth*: Zero Trust AuthZ and Trust Models

**ZTAuth\*** is a Zero Trust compliant open protocol that provides secure, identity-driven access to resources, enforcing least privilege at the application edge. Designed for eventual consistency, it maintains the security state during network disruptions and automatically synchronizes when connectivity is restored.

**ZTAuth*** does not replace existing standards. Instead, it enhances them by adding a dedicated layer for fine-grained, reproducible authorization across both human and non-human identities.
