# ZTAuth*: Zero Trust AuthZ and Trust Models

**ZTAuth\*** is a Zero Trust compliant protocol for secure, identity-based access at the application edge. It supports eventual consistency and resilient synchronization across network disruptions. Built with a delegation-first model, it is ideal for systems that require secure and auditable delegation.

**ZTAuth*** does not replace existing standards. Instead, it enhances them by adding a dedicated layer for fine-grained, reproducible authorization across both human and non-human identities.
